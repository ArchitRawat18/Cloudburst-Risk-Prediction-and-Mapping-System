# 🌀 **Two-Phase Roadmap for Cloudburst Risk Mapping Platform**

---

## **🔹 Phase 1 (Sem 7)** – *Baseline Mapping & Historical Risk Model*

**Goal:** Build the foundation by using **historical & static data**.

### Steps:

1. **Collect Historical Data**

   * Past cloudburst/flood/landslide events (ISRO Bhuvan, IMD reports).
   * Long-term rainfall data (NASA GPM, IMD).
   * Terrain info (DEM, slope, altitude).

2. **Build Risk Model**

   * Train ML model/classifier:
     Inputs → (rainfall intensity, humidity, slope, cloud cover, past patterns).
     Output → **Probability of cloudburst occurrence**.

3. **Mapping Hotspots**

   * Generate a **cloudburst risk map (historical hotspots)**.
   * Colour-coded severity zones → (Low/Med/High Risk).
   * Visualize on **GIS dashboard** (Leaflet/Mapbox).

✅ At this stage, you already have a **functional system**:

* Input → Past data.
* Output → A **risk-prone area map** (static + interactive).

---

## **🔹 Phase 2 (Sem 8)** – *Dynamic Forecast Integration & Live Prediction*

**Goal:** Make it **live, dynamic, and product-like**.

### Steps:

1. **Add Forecast Data**

   * Fetch **daily/hourly forecast** from APIs (OpenWeather, IMD).
   * Parameters: rainfall (mm/hr), humidity, pressure, temperature.

2. **Live Risk Prediction**

   * Feed forecast data into your trained model.
   * Generate **probabilistic risk scores for next 1–7 days**.

3. **Future Risk Mapping**

   * Interactive map with **time slider** → Day 1, Day 2, … Day 7.
   * Each day shows a **forecasted cloudburst risk heatmap**.

4. **Alerts/Notifications (optional add-on)**

   * If risk > threshold → SMS/App alert:
     *“High chance of cloudburst in Kedarnath Valley (Risk: 78%) within next 48 hrs.”*

✅ At this stage, your system becomes:

* **Continuous** (keeps running daily).
* **Predictive** (future 7-day mapping).
* **Practical** (for authorities, trekkers, citizens).

---

## 🔑 In Simple Words

* **Phase 1 = Make a map of where cloudbursts have happened and where they are *likely* to happen (historically & geographically).**
* **Phase 2 = Add live weather forecasts to show *when* and *how likely* they will happen in the coming days.**

---

⚡ This progression shows mentors:

1. You start realistic (mapping hotspots).
2. Then scale to **forecast-based predictions**.
3. The end result → **an evolving, usable platform** (not a one-time program).

1. Introduction
A cloudburst is a sudden and extremely heavy rainfall event occurring in a short span, usually over a small geographical area. It often leads to flash floods, landslides, and severe infrastructure damage, particularly in mountainous regions like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
Predicting cloudbursts is highly challenging because:
•	They occur in very localized areas (few sq. km).
•	They last for a short duration but involve very high rainfall intensity (>100 mm/hour).

Due to these challenges, many regions lack an early-warning system, resulting in loss of life and property. Existing solutions are limited to manual alerts and government monitoring, which are often delayed.
This project aims to develop an intelligent system that uses historical data, weather patterns, and terrain features to identify risk-prone zones. The system will provide an interactive GIS map to visualize these areas, helping authorities and citizens prepare better.
________________________________________
2. Problem Statement
The absence of a localized cloudburst risk mapping and decision support system creates significant vulnerability for communities in mountainous areas. Existing forecasting models by meteorological departments do not provide real-time, region-specific alerts accessible to the general public.
Our project addresses this gap by creating:
•	A baseline risk model from historical data and terrain characteristics.
•	A GIS-based visualization platform to show cloudburst-prone areas.
________________________________________

3. Objectives
•	To collect and analyze historical weather and terrain data related to cloudbursts.
•	To create a risk prediction model based on identified patterns.
•	To develop a visual dashboard to display risk-prone zones interactively.
•	To establish a foundation for future real-time prediction and alerting system.
________________________________________

4. Proposed Methodology
Step 1: Data Collection
•	Weather Data:
o	Historical rainfall intensity, humidity, temperature (IMD, NASA GPM).
•	Geographic Data:
o	Elevation and slope maps from SRTM/ASTER DEM.
•	Event Records:
o	Past cloudburst incidents from ISRO Bhuvan and research papers.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
•	Remove missing values and normalize datasets.
•	Convert rainfall and terrain data into structured format.
Step 3: Model Development
•	Train ML algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) to predict risk levels.
•	Use statistical thresholds for low, medium, and high-risk categories.
Step 4: GIS Visualization
•	Build an interactive web map using Leaflet.js or Mapbox.
•	Show color-coded zones based on risk level.
•	Provide filters (by date, region, rainfall pattern).
________________________________________

5. Technology Stack
•	Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
•	Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS
•	Visualization: Leaflet.js / Mapbox
•	Backend: Flask / Django
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
•	Tools: QGIS (for pre-processing maps)
________________________________________

6. Expected Outcome
•	A functional dashboard displaying high-risk areas for cloudbursts based on historical patterns.
•	A baseline model that can later integrate live forecasts for real-time risk prediction.
________________________________________

7. Future Scope
•	Add live weather data from APIs (OpenWeather, IMD).
•	Provide 7-day cloudburst risk forecast maps.
•	Expand to include flood and landslide risk prediction.
•	Implement alert notifications (SMS/app) for high-risk areas.

Perfectly noted, Archit 👌 This phase is where you must **make the project look like a real, research-backed product**, not “just a simple prediction program.” Since the **synopsis report (30–35 pages)** is the main evaluation, we need to **go beyond requirements** and prepare:
